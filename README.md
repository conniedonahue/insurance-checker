# Insurance Eligibility Checker

- Quick scratch-pad draft of a full-stack app that checks a user's eligibility for health insurance.
- I dug into [pverify](https://pverify.io/) to model an API call to a third-party eligibility checker.
  - Note: this app doesn't actually interact with _pverify_. Under the hood it is just checking to see if if the user is a Gemini.
- Tech stack: TypeScript, Next.js, React, Nest, Tailwind.
